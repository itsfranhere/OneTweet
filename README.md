# OneTweet
One Tweet project

typography and creating meaning with text.

This was the second project that was given to us and we had one more brief to accomplish. we needed to choose a tweet from the options below and follow some rules to produce several variations. We couldn’t use images, as we were only allowed to use text for a deep knowledge of the same.

The brief:

1. Choose a tweet (short text of up to 140 characters).

2. Use your chosen tweet to create a poster. Your poster must follow these rules:

- Text-only, no pictures
- 1 font-family
- 3 colours max
- Square format: width = height
- Vector file

4. Produce several variations of your poster (min 5), exploring:

- Closure
- Symmetry
- Figure/ground relationship
- Connectedness
- Proximity
- Continuation
- Similarity
- Past experience

I choose Snowden due to its  popularity and I felt that I had a lot more information to work with, and aesthetically make it presentable short tweet. I tried to deliver great work experiences in order of providing a meaningful artwork.

I did some research about Snowdento know more about his historical content and I found a lot as I expected. Edward Snowden is a former National Security Agency subcontractor who made headlines in 2013 when he leaked top secret information about NSA surveillance activities.
Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by other newspapers including Der Spiegel and The New York Times.

I tried to adapt all this concept by engaging a range of numerous examples, so that a bit of its historical content could stand out. I started  by doing some sketches and then getting the best solution for each one during the entire process.my goal was  to arrange a powerful connection between the visual and the concept.

After some thoughts about the presentation, I definitely agree the feedback that was given to me. I was able to understand that sometimes less is better and that we can communicate  better with big images rather than a wide variety of small ones, it gives the audience more credibility when trying to share our ideas and concepts.

In conclusion, I was very enthusiastic with this project. It is always an enriching experience when  you are asked to produce content within a specific topic to get more knowledge about it. Typography revealed itself to be crucial in visual design and it is fabulous how can we use it to communicate straight away.

I very pleased with the experience and the skills I got during the project, I also aim to improve within the feedback that I was told.
